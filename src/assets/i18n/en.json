        "P1": "In the anonymous ecosystem of public blockchains, identity (ID) is the origin of an individual, a thing or an organization, it is the foundation of trust, credit, ownership, and history of the related object. In the blockchain value system, identity (ID) is the basis or value, ownership or rights rely to, it is the bridge between the blockchain ecosystem and the real society.",
        "P2": "Blockchain is called the Internet of Value. The activities of the Internet of Value are not limited to the collection and issuance of coins, but involve intricate production relations including unlimited derivation outside the chain. Identity becomes an extremely complex ecosystem. The indispensable unique identifier in the relationship.",
        "P3": "In fact, relying on the blockchain will establish a new economic system, and it will also give identity more extraordinary meaning. For example, if you spend a sum of money to eat a meal, in the traditional economy During the study, everything is over after the meal, and both parties do a balance calculation afterwards. But in the blockchain ecology, if a suitable model is established, this meal may have a profound impact and ultimately benefit It may far exceed the value of this meal-consumption may become investment. You are no longer a mere consumer, but a consumer. The meaning of identity can be seen.",
        "P4": "Unique certainty of identity",
        "P5": "In the system, the public key is used as the ID of the identity, called the identity key, which is the unique certainty of the identity. Usually, the public key of a blockchain wallet can be used as the identity ID, which will provide the corresponding wallet activities Deterministic identity authentication.",
        "P6": "Identity Type",
        "P7": "In the system, there are three types of identities: people, things, and organizations, which correspond to people, everything in the biological sense of the real society, and organizational units composed of people engaged in various social activities.",
        "P8": "Information content and authenticity",
        "P9": "All information is entered by the owner of the identity. The authenticity is the responsibility of the identity owner. Anyone else cannot control or tamper with, and whether the information is trusted is completely determined by the information adopter. It needs to be clear that in In the blockchain ecology, all false information and bad behavior may cause permanent damage to the identity owner.",
        "P10": "Privacy Protection",
        "P11": "Whether all or a piece of information is confidential or public, and whether it is publicly disclosed conditionally or unconditionally, is determined by the identity owner and cannot be changed by anyone else.",
        "P12": "Authoritative Limitation of Information",
        "P13": "In the blockchain world, there is no absolute authoritative intermediary agency. All authority is a limited concept. For example, if an organization initiates an activity, participants need to be KYC certified by the Monetary Authority. In this case, you need to enter the necessary KYC certification information such as ID card, driver’s license and other information in the identity system, and you need to open this information to the corresponding KYC certification department. Once your identity is recognized by the agency, you can participate in this Events.",
        "P14": "But another activity initiated by another entity may require other authoritative authentication, and the above recognition is not suitable."
